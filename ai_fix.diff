## Error Analysis: Webpack Build Failure

The provided log "Simulated Webpack failure" is too generic to determine the root cause of the build issue. To generate a valid fix, I need more specific error information from the Webpack build process.

Please provide the detailed output from the CI build, specifically the console logs generated by Webpack during the failure. This typically includes:

1.  **Specific error messages:** Such as "Module not found", "Syntax error", "WebpackError:", etc.
2.  **File paths:** Indicating where the error occurred (e.g., `src/index.js`, `webpack.config.js`).
3.  **Line numbers and column numbers:** If it's a code-related error.
4.  **Loader/Plugin issues:** If a specific loader or plugin is failing.

Without this detailed information, any proposed fix would be purely speculative. Common Webpack issues include:
*   Missing or incorrect loaders (e.g., `babel-loader`, `css-loader`, `ts-loader`).
*   Syntax errors in source files.
*   Incorrect Webpack configuration (`webpack.config.js`).
*   Missing dependencies in `package.json` that are required by Webpack or its loaders/plugins.
*   Version incompatibilities between Webpack and its ecosystem packages.
